# Reading Start 2.0

### 🎵 Inclusive Sing-Along Application for Children

ReadingStar 2.0 is an accessibility-focused educational application built in collaboration with **Intel** and the **National Autistic Society**.  
The project continues the mission of the original ReadingStar app — enabling children, particularly those on the autism spectrum, to sing along with songs in a structured and supportive environment.

## 🚀 Overview
This version reimagines the original ReadingStar by allowing users to **generate or upload songs**, with lyrics synchronized for karaoke-style playback.  
The application aims to foster reading, rhythm, and engagement through interactive music-based learning.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Electron** – Desktop UI framework for a modern and accessible user experience  
- **FastAPI** – Backend API serving model requests and managing audio/text data  
- **Python** – Core logic for text generation, audio processing, and lyric alignment  
- **Nuitka** – Compiles Python code into C-based executables for performance and Windows distribution (.exe)

## 🧠 Key Features
- Upload or generate custom karaoke tracks from text prompts  
- Automatically generate rhyming lyrics and instrumentals  
- Sing-along interface optimized for accessibility and focus  
- Fully offline-capable backend with local models (MIT-licensed)

## 📦 Project Goals
- Develop a functional, user-friendly prototype for presentation at the **BETT Conference**  
- Produce a working **.exe build** by **February**, packaged with Nuitka  
- Maintain compliance with NAS ethical standards (no direct testing with autistic children)
